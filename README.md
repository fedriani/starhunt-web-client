# The AAS WorldWide Telescope Web client

The “web client” of the [AAS](https://aas.org/)
[WorldWide Telescope](http://worldwidetelescope.org/home) (WWT) is a web
application that lets you explore the universe from the comfort of your chair.

### <http://worldwidetelescope.org/webclient>

WWT is a free, open-source tool for visually exploring humanity’s scientific
understanding of the Universe. The web client is the primary portal by which
people interact with WWT — allowing interactive exploration of terabytes of
astronomical data in a seamlessly integrated 4D simulation of the known
universe. However, the WWT software ecosystem also includes a Windows
application that can power planetariums (see [wwt-windows-client]), a
cloud-based web service for discovering and sharing astronomical data (see
[wwt-website]), and [pywwt], a Python module allowing users to write their own
software to control and extend all of these systems.

WWT is brought to you by the non-profit [American Astronomical Society] (AAS)
and the [.NET Foundation]. Established in 1899 and based in Washington, DC,
the AAS is the major organization of professional astronomers in North
America.
